# Test Devices Store
> In this mini-app we want to replicate a given frontend schema, pretending we want to build a smart devices online store.\
> To speed up the development process, I have used [_this site_](https://www.phonehouse.es) as UI example, changing a few elements and the page structure to adapt it to what is requested by the test.

<!-- > Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->
